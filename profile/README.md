Itâ€™s inevitable. Something remarkable is coming.

There is an imminent paradigm change in how software is crafted.

Software is eating the world. A new generation of software tools is already a huge productivity multiplier.

At chasing brains, we explore how a single person (or a tiny team) can build with the speed of a large organization.

Also, we are working on a next generation of tools that enable that. Early versions of which will be published in March.
